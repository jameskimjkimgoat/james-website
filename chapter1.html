    <h2>Creative Title: Is an Academic title really necessary to discuss fictional characters in contemporary American literature?</h2>
    <p>
      "Nothing else exists for her now beyond this moment. The engine's cut. Ready! Set! Go! She dives through the door. Like a body surfer." This is a quote from the article <em>"An Exploration of High Risk Leisure Consumption Through Skydiving"</em>. What if there were novels with protagonists who live every moment of their lives like skydivers who momentarily engage in high-risk leisure activities? Well, two of the most influential writers of this topic are Jerzy Kozinski and J.D. Salinger. Kozinski's <em>Being There</em> and Salinger's <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> both explore individuals who live life like a reckless game, and go wherever their heart takes them. While <em>Being There</em> focuses on the internal turmoil that happens to the protagonist as he figures out the world with the brain age of a child, <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> focuses both on the physical and internal journey of Holden Caulfield as he thugs out the whole situation after getting expelled.

      Jerzy Kozinski illustrates how Chance's childlike innocence and small portion of exposure to the world in his early ages makes him flexible and gives him the confidence to explore new concepts. When Chance meets the president of the United States through Rand, whom he got to know through Rand's wife, who hit Chance with a car and brought him home to take care of him. He does not understand a single word going on between Rand and the president, however, when he hears the word "garden", he starts fervently explaining the nature of a garden. " 'In a garden', he said; 'growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there are also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again. As long as the roots are not served, all is well and all will be well' ". (Kozinski, 54)

      Chance, living in the old man's house and being a gardener his whole life, everything he saw, heard, sensed as he stepped out of the house must have all been brand new to him. Even though he did not understand any word going between Rand and the president regarding politics. His pure, not jaded innocence allows him to speak with confidence of what he knows best. He does not care what others think of him, or perhaps, he does not yet understand the basis of human interaction. Living in Mr Rand's house and hanging out with Mr Rand, Chance gets to meet some of the most powerful men in the country and becomes famous due to his intriguing aura.

    <blockquote>
      "In a garden, things grow ... but first, they must wither; trees have to lose their leaves in order to put forth new leaves, and to grow thicker and stronger and taller. Some trees die, but fresh saplings replace them. Gardens need a lot of care. But if you love your garden, you don't mind working in it, and waiting. Then in the proper season you will surely see it nourish." (Kozinski, 67)
    </blockquote>

      As a result of Chance saying these bars on live television, a lot of people developed a seed of hope they could all use in their lives. Chance's childlike innocence, and assumable lack of understanding could've been the reason why he made this bold decision to speak on live TV, but the interesting thing is that he was at least aware he was being invited to speak about economics, and he knew nothing about economics but still accepted this offer and spoke with confidence. Ultimately, it was Chance's pure curiosity and innocence that allowed him to accept this deal fearlessly, and it's also a factor that draws people to Chance. His unbiased and unpolluted mindset truly fosters and spreads a positive message out there which fits just right into the economic situation of the novel, but can really be applied to any aspect of one's life.
