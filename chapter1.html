    <h2>Essay</h2>
    <p>
      "Nothing else exists for her now beyond this moment. The engine's cut. Ready! Set! Go! She dives through the door. Like a body surfer." This is a quote from the article <em>"An Exploration of High Risk Leisure Consumption Through Skydiving"</em>. What if there were novels with protagonists who live every moment of their lives like skydivers who momentarily engage in high-risk leisure activities? Well, two of the most influential writers of this topic are Jerzy Kozinski and J.D. Salinger. Kozinski's <em>Being There</em> and Salinger's <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> both explore individuals who live life like a reckless game, and go wherever their heart takes them. While <em>Being There</em> focuses on the internal turmoil that happens to the protagonist as he figures out the world with the brain age of a child, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> focuses both on the physical and internal journey of Holden Caulfield as he thugs out the whole situation after getting expelled.
    </p>

    <h3>Childlike Innocence in Being There</h3>
    <p>
      Jerzy Kozinski illustrates how Chance's childlike innocence and small portion of exposure to the world in his early years make him flexible and give him the confidence to explore new concepts. When Chance meets the president of the United States through Rand, whom he got to know through Rand's wife, who hit Chance with a car and brought him home to take care of him, he does not understand a single word going on between Rand and the president. However, when he hears the word "garden," he starts fervently explaining the nature of a garden.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      " 'In a garden,' he said; 'growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there are also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again. As long as the roots are not served, all is well and all will be well'." (Kozinski, 54)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Living in the old man's house and being a gardener his whole life, everything Chance saw, heard, and sensed as he stepped out of the house must have all been brand new to him. Even though he did not understand any word going between Rand and the president regarding politics, his pure, unjaded innocence allows him to speak with confidence about what he knows best. He does not care what others think of him, or perhaps, he does not yet understand the basis of human interaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Dilemmas and Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      Jerzy Kozinski also illustrates some of the dilemmas Chance faces as his exposure to the outside world suddenly increases and how this changes his perception of the world. As time goes by and Mr. Rand's sickness worsens, Rand talks about his perception of death, which contradicts Chance's knowledge of the world and nature of life.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "No one likes a dying man, Chauncey, because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it." (Kozinski, 89)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The death Mr. Rand describes is pessimistic, contrasting the novel's overarching message of hope and optimism. These clashing ideals challenge Chance's untouched and childlike innocence.
    </p>

    <h3>Holden Caulfield's Reckless Behavior</h3>
    <p>
      While Kozinski's <em>Being There</em> focuses on Chance's childlike innocence, Salinger's <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> focuses on Holden Caulfield's reckless behavior. Holden is a troublemaker—a heavy smoker and drinker—who illustrates his biased nature as an "unreliable narrator" through the troubles he faces.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Just stop lying. Once I get started, I can go on for hours if I feel like it. Hours." (Salinger, 76)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This quote showcases Holden's tendency to lie when placed in unfavorable situations. His hyperbolic overreaction to events often highlights his internal struggle and immense sadness.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Kozinski and Salinger both illustrate protagonists who treat life in a way most people don't. They are both experimental and risk-takers, which makes them run into new events and even face dilemmas. While <em>Being There</em> focuses on the internal conflict that happens to Chance, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> explores both the physical and internal journey of Holden as he navigates the world after being expelled from his school.
