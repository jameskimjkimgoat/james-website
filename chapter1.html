      "Nothing else exists for her now beyond this moment. The engine's cut. Ready! Set! Go! She dives through the door. Like a body surfer." This is a quote from the article <em>"An Exploration of High Risk Leisure Consumption Through Skydiving"</em>. What if there were novels with protagonists who live every moment of their lives like skydivers who momentarily engage in high-risk leisure activities? Well, two of the most influential writers of this topic are Jerzy Kozinski and J.D. Salinger. Kozinski's <em>Being There</em> and Salinger's <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> both explore individuals who live life like a reckless game, and go wherever their heart takes them. While <em>Being There</em> focuses on the internal turmoil that happens to the protagonist as he figures out the world with the brain age of a child, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> focuses both on the physical and internal journey of Holden Caulfield as he thugs out the whole situation after getting expelled.
