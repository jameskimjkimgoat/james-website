    <h2>Essay</h2>
    <p>
      "Nothing else exists for her now beyond this moment. The engine's cut. Ready! Set! Go! She dives through the door. Like a body surfer." This is a quote from the article <em>"An Exploration of High Risk Leisure Consumption Through Skydiving"</em>. What if there were novels with protagonists who live every moment of their lives like skydivers who momentarily engage in high-risk leisure activities? Well, two of the most influential writers of this topic are Jerzy Kozinski and J.D. Salinger. Kozinski's <em>Being There</em> and Salinger's <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> both explore individuals who live life like a reckless game, and go wherever their heart takes them. While <em>Being There</em> focuses on the internal turmoil that happens to the protagonist as he figures out the world with the brain age of a child, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> focuses both on the physical and internal journey of Holden Caulfield as he thugs out the whole situation after getting expelled.

      Kozinski and Salinger both illustrate protagonists who treat life in a way most people don't. They are both experimental and risk-takers, which makes them run into new events and even face dilemmas. While <em>Being There</em> focuses on the internal conflict that happens to Chance, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> explores both the physical and internal journey of Holden as he navigates the world after being expelled from his school.
