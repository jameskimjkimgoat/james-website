    <h2>Essay</h2>
    <p>
      Have you ever thought about how everything... EVERYTHING might just be a game? Your life, your friends, your beloved ones, it's just a dream inside your head? Well...what if I told you there are protagonists who face a moment where they come to a realization that their life wasn't real. Chuck Palahniuk's <em>Fight Club</em> and Mary Harron's film <em>American Psycho</em> are two of the most influential pieces of media that promote critique of how social structure disables people's ability to distinguish reality from fantasy.
    </p>

    <h3>Fight Club: Duality and Chaos</h3>
    <p>
      Chuck Palahniuk's <em>Fight Club</em> explores the destructive effects of consumerism and societal expectations on an individual's mental health. The protagonist, an unnamed narrator, creates an alter ego named Tyler Durden, who represents his repressed desires and frustrations. Together, they establish "Fight Club" as a way to reclaim their masculinity and break free from societal norms.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything." (Palahniuk, 70)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This quote highlights the protagonist's realization that true freedom comes from letting go of material possessions and societal expectations. However, as the story progresses, Tyler's anarchistic ideals spiral out of control, leading to chaos and destruction.
    </p>

    <h3>American Psycho: Identity and Insanity</h3>
    <p>
      Mary Harron's <em>American Psycho</em>, based on Bret Easton Ellis's novel, delves into the life of Patrick Bateman, a wealthy investment banker who hides his psychopathic tendencies behind a facade of success and normalcy. The film critiques the superficiality of 1980s consumer culture and the dehumanizing effects of capitalism.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me." (Ellis, 376)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This line encapsulates Bateman's existential crisis and his inability to connect with his own identity. His violent fantasies and actions blur the line between reality and delusion, leaving the audience questioning what is real and what is imagined.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Both <em>Fight Club</em> and <em>American Psycho</em> tackle themes of identity, duality, and societal critique. While the narrator in <em>Fight Club</em> finds freedom in chaos, Patrick Bateman in <em>American Psycho</em> becomes trapped in his own delusions. These works challenge the audience to question their own perceptions of reality and the influence of societal expectations on their identities.
