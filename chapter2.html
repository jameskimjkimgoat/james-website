    <h2>Creative Title: Is this all a game?</h2>
    <h3>Academic Title: Is an academic title really necessary if it’s all a game?</h3>

    <p>
      Have you ever thought about how everything... EVERYTHING might just be a game? Your life, your friends, your beloved ones, it's just a dream inside your head? Well...what if I told you there are protagonists who face a moment where they come to a realization that their life wasn't real. Chuck Palahniuk's <em>Fight Club</em> and Harry Harron's film <em>American Psycho</em> are two of the most influential pieces of media that promote critique of how social structure disables people's ability to distinguish reality from fantasy. While <em>Fight Club</em> illustrates the protagonist's dual personality and his shattered life between two personae inside himself, <em>American Psycho</em> focuses on how the protagonist slowly loses himself by presenting himself and others as someone else, or not themselves to meet societal expectations.
    </p>

    <h3>Critique of Materialistic Fulfillment in Fight Club</h3>
    <p>
      Chuck Palahniuk illustrates the protagonist's pessimistic view on life and how materialistic goods do not fulfill him in life. Early on in the novel, the narrator reflects on his life as a businessman and pities himself for having to go to a meeting every day for people who got their testicles removed, just to put him around people with miseries and feel raw emotion through empathy to feel alive.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "It's easy to cry when you realize that everyone you love will reject you or die. On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone will drop to zero." (Palahniuk, 17)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This quote gives an insight into the narrator's worldview. The narrator suffers from severe insomnia, and the only way he can fall asleep is by going to the no-testicle club and crying until his eyes get tired. This mindset, where the narrator thinks life is futile because all humans must face inevitable death, shows the narrator's pessimistic attitude towards life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing the narrator does is buy fancy furniture to fill out his apartment. He believes his buying power and the ability to decorate his apartment reflect his personality. However, he comes to a realization that this is pointless as well.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Then you're trapped in your own lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you." (Palahniuk, 44)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The narrator enjoys buying unique and extravagant furniture, spending countless hours deciding what to buy next. However, he soon realizes this is not making him happy anymore but only makes him seek more and better things. This reflects human nature, where our desires are endless, and materialistic needs can never be satisfied.
    </p>

    <h3>Duality of Protagonists in Fight Club and American Psycho</h3>
    <p>
      Patrick Bateman's acknowledgment of his psychopathic condition serves as a catalyst to fuel his double-sided nature and motivates him to be an outlaw and eliminate what goes against him, no matter the cost. Patrick Bateman—a successful businessman in Manhattan, New York—starts off the movie with an acknowledgment of his character:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "There is an idea of Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me; only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours... I simply am not there." (Harron, 00:06:00)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Harron uses sensory details like "some kind of abstraction" and "only an entity" to underscore the inexistence and void within Patrick Bateman. Patrick is described here as if he is a ghost—others can feel him and see him physically in the same space, but he "simply is not there."
    </p>

    <h3>Shared Ambiguity Between Fight Club and American Psycho</h3>
    <p>
      Chuck Palahniuk's <em>Fight Club</em> and Harry Harron's <em>American Psycho</em> are both representative pieces of media where the protagonists face internal conflict about whether the things going around them are real or not. They are essentially psychopaths. However, it is fascinating to see how people can become diabolic and act irrationally when pushed to the edge of society, unable to express their true selves or find fulfillment. Both the narrator from <em>Fight Club</em> and Patrick Bateman from <em>American Psycho</em> face an ambiguous conclusion about whether or not anything is real at all.
